Prediction: No acute pulmonary disease.

=== Sample 366 ===
Input: In the interval, the interval, there has been development of multiple nodules in both the upper and lower lobes bilaterally. The previously identified left lower lobe nodule has increased in size. Left hemidiaphragm is slightly elevated, possibly from splinting.
Reference: Multiple pulmonary nodules consistent with metastases. Chest, abdomen, and pelvis CT with contrast would be helpful for further evaluation.
Prediction: 1. Cardiomegaly without acute disease. 2. Increased left lower lobe nodule.

=== Sample 367 ===
Input: The XXXX examination consists of frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest. The cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits. Pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits.
Reference: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
Prediction: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.

=== Sample 368 ===
Input: Specifically, no evidence of focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. Visualized osseous structures of the thorax are without acute abnormality.
Reference: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
Prediction: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.

=== Sample 369 ===
Input: Normal heart size and mediastinal contours. Lungs are clear. Degenerative changes are seen in the spine.
Reference: No acute cardiopulmonary process. .
Prediction: No active disease.

=== Sample 370 ===
Input: No airspace disease, effusion or noncalcified nodule. Calcified granuloma seen bilaterally. Degenerative changes demonstrated within the visualized thoracic spine.
Reference: 1. No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. 2. Elevation of the right XXXX diaphragm, containing liver.
Prediction: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.

=== Sample 371 ===
Input: Thoracic spondylosis. Mild dextroscoliosis of the spine. Prior anterior cervical fusion.
Reference: Emphysema without superimposed pneumonia.

Input: A persistent patchy infiltrate is present in the right middle lobe. Pulmonary XXXX are normal. Aorta remains tortuous.
Reference: Cleared left lower lobe airspace disease with persistent right middle lobe airspace disease.
Prediction: Patchy patchy infiltrate in the right middle lobe. No acute cardiopulmonary disease.

=== Sample 373 ===
Input: No focal infiltrate or effusion. Heart and mediastinal contours within normal limits. No displaced fracture identified.
Reference: Low volumes with bronchovascular crowding. No acute abnormality.
Prediction: 1. No acute cardiopulmonary disease.
